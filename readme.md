## EmotionIcon

### What is it?
EmotionIcon is a discord bot I have made for one of my servers.

### What does it do?
EmotionIcon scrapes messages from a discord server and if it detects
a valid emote, primarily twitch emotes, it'll send that emote 

### Why?
I send a lot of twitch emotes in discord because im a dork and I thought 
it'd be cool if it would actually use the emote like twitch chat does 

### Specs (I don't know if that's the right thing)
I chose python3.9 for the main branch because it supports
the type hint list[str] that will break with less than 3.9
If I feel like it and I might, I might make a <3.9 ver one so that 
more people can use it
